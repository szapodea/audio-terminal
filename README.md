# Voice controlled command line bash shell
### Current working commands:
- ls
  - list

#### Note: 
Current functionality is limited to running 
```
python3 command.py
```
and then saying the specific command. In the future, command.py will only need to be ran once, and will potentially
wait for a keyword and then begin listening 



To add flags, say either option or flag followed by the wanted flag.

For example,
```commandline
ls -la
```
will be said as 
```
list option l a 
```
or 
```
list flag l a
```
